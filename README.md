For bare minimum usage look at the example provided by the towards data science article.

I think what I will be doing is having a thing where you can get notified when something like an xbox is added to stock.

In order to complete something like that, I think I will need to have it loop every x amount of seconds to check if it has been
restocked or not. Once it is restocked, it will terminate the loop and loop until it is out of stock and then it will go back to the other state.
Once it is in stock, it will send a notification message to all who have oped in and provide the link to go to cart.
